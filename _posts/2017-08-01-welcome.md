Hey there!
Welcome to BITS ACM's newest venture, a technical blog where all the members pool their knowledge with respect to their field of interest.  

<br>
## How to post?

All members need to follow the following process:
1. Fork the [_BITS-ACM Blog_][blog] repository in your respective GitHub account.
2. In the `_posts` directory, create a new file in the following format:  
        `YYYY-MM-DD-TitleOfYourPost.md`
3. Before beginning with your post, write down the following at the top:  

    ```
      ---
      layout: post
      title:  "Title of your post"
      tags: [All the tags asscoiated with your post]
      author: Your Name
      desc: A One-liner description
      ---
      ```
        

4. Write down your post with **proper formatting** in Markdown.  
   You can go through the following [_10-minutes-markdown Tutorial_][tut] if you feel the need.  
   A comprehensive guide to Markdown will shortly be posted.  

### Author Settings:
1. After you are through with the post, open the `_authors` folder and create a Markdown file in the following format:  
         `Your Name.md`
2. Write down the following front-matter in the Markdown file:  

     ```
      ---
      layout: author
      title: Your Name
      image_path: /images/xyz.jpg
      intro: One-liner introduction
      ---
      ```
        

   To change the author image open the `images` folder and upload your image. Do not forget to change the `image_path` in the front-matter.
3. Give a short description of yourself with **proper formatting**.

This completes the entire process!  
Now send a pull request to the blog repository which will be merged accordingly!  
Peace Out!
